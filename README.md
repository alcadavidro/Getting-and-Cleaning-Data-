# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Assignment

###Introduction

This repository contains the course assignment of 'Getting and Cleaning Data' to test the skills acquired in the course. 
The content of this repo is: 
1. Data downloaded from the UCI - Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
2. An R script called `run_analysis.R` that was used to download the data and clean it to get two Tidy data sets. 
3. The `CodeBook.md`describes the variables of the tidy datasets, the data, and the transformations that was performed in the original data to get the desired clean data. 
4. Two Tidy datasets, one that has all the observations for the mean and standar deviation variables, and one with the average of each variable for each subject and each activity. 

Also I included the `README` file of the original data set, so anyone can contextualize more about the raw data.
